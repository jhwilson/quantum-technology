# The Qubit 

The fundamental building block of the classical computer was the bit: A 0 or 1 that could be manipulated by a classical computer (via transistors, see @sec-transistors).
In a similar manner, quantum computation has the "quantum bit" or just _qubit_, for short.  This leads us to the linear algebra of $2\times 2$ matrices, as we will see. Despite the apparent simplicity, we can already see many of the key features of quantum mechanics in this simple system.

## The qubit Hilbert space

A qubit will be in two-dimensional complex vector space equipped with an inner product.

### Qubit states

For the qubit, we associate two states with two different basis vectors: $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$. This will be called the _computational basis_. The magic[^1] of quantum mechanics is that a state need not be just one or the other, but could be _any_ linear superposition of these
$$
\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}.
$$ {#eq-qubit}
In this, we have adopted the _bra-ket_ notation due to Dirac. While it can be quite useful, we can write this in terms of matrices and vectors
$$
\ket{0} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \ket{1} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
This makes it clear that these states are _orthogonal_ $\braket{0|1} = 0$.

In this case we have
$$
\ket{\psi} = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{bmatrix}.
$$
We also need the conjugate transpose, the Hermitian conjugate, of this vector, which will be a row-vector
$$
\bra{\psi} = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha^* & \beta^* \end{bmatrix}.
$$
The key feature of quantum mechanics is that these states must be _normalized_, meaning that the probability of finding the system in any state must sum to 1. This means that
$$
\braket{\psi|\psi} = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha^* & \beta^* \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \alpha \\ \beta \end{bmatrix} = |\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1.
$$
In matrix notation, this is just the dot product of a vector with its complex conjugate.

We can also write operators that act on these states. The simplest operator is the Pauli $Z$ operator, which in matrix form is
$$
Z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
When this operator acts on our basis states, we find
$$
Z\ket{0} = \ket{0}, \quad Z\ket{1} = -\ket{1}.
$$
This means that $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ are _eigenstates_ of $Z$ with eigenvalues $+1$ and $-1$ respectively. For a general state $\ket{\psi}$, measuring $Z$ will yield either $+1$ or $-1$, with probabilities determined by $|\alpha|^2$ and $|\beta|^2$ respectively.

### Qubit operators

Since this is linear algebra, we can write a general operator $\mathcal O$ as a matrix
$$
\mathcal O = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}.
$$
Often, we are interested in the eigenvalues and eigenstates of these operators $\mathcal O \ket{\psi_{i}} = \lambda_i \ket{\psi_i}$. 
Generically, we can find these by solving a polynomial equation
$$
\det(\mathcal O - \lambda I) = 0.
$$

Solving this step-by-step
$$
\det(\mathcal O - \lambda I) = \begin{vmatrix} a-\lambda & b \\ c & d-\lambda \end{vmatrix} = 0,
$$
which gives us
$$
(a-\lambda)(d-\lambda) - bc = 0.
$$
This is a quadratic equation that we can solve:
$$
\lambda^2 - (a+d)\lambda + (ad-bc) = 0.
$$

The eigenvalues are therefore
$$
\lambda_{\pm} = \frac{a+d \pm \sqrt{(a-d)^2 + 4bc}}{2}.
$$ {#eq-evals-two-by-two}

For quantum mechanical **observables** (see @sec-postulate-observable), we are particularly interested in _Hermitian_ operators where $\mathcal O = \mathcal O^\dagger$, 
$$
\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a^* & c^* \\ b^* & d^* \end{bmatrix}
$$
This means that $a$ and $d$ must be real and $c = b^*$. In this case, the eigenvalues are always real, as we can see from the @eq-evals-two-by-two.

A particularly important class of operators are **unitary operators**, where $U^\dagger U = UU^\dagger = I$. These are what we use for time-evolution, see @sec-postulate-unitary.

These operators preserve the inner product between states:
$$
\braket{U\psi|U\phi} = \braket{\psi|\phi}
$$
For a $2\times 2$ matrix
$$
U = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix},
$$
the unitarity condition means that
$$
\begin{bmatrix} a^* & c^* \\ b^* & d^* \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
$$

This gives us several conditions:

1. $|a|^2 + |c|^2 = 1$ (normalization of first column)
2. $|b|^2 + |d|^2 = 1$ (normalization of second column)
3. $ab^* + cd^* = 0$ (orthogonality of columns)

This immediately gives us some insight into these operators. If we define,
$$
\ket{\psi_1} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}, \quad \ket{\psi_2} = \begin{bmatrix} c \\ d \end{bmatrix},
$$
then we have $\braket{\psi_1|\psi_1} = 1 = \braket{\psi_2|\psi_2}$ and $\braket{\psi_1|\psi_2} = 0$.

An important property of unitary operators is that their eigenvalues always have magnitude 1, meaning they can be written as $e^{i\theta}$ for some real $\theta$. This makes them natural operators for describing quantum evolution, as we will see later.


A particularly important set of operators are the Pauli operators. We've already seen the Pauli $Z$ operator. The other two are
$$
X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad Y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
$$
These operators satisfy some important algebraic relations:
$$
X^2 = Y^2 = Z^2 = I, \quad XY = iZ, \quad YZ = iX, \quad ZX = iY.
$$

These operators form a complete basis for $2\times 2$ matrices, meaning we can write any operator as
$$
\mathcal O = aI + bX + cY + dZ,
$$
where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are complex numbers (though they must satisfy certain conditions if we want $\mathcal O$ to be Hermitian).
