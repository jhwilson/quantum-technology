# Superconducting qubits

Superconducting qubits represent one of the most promising and widely pursued platforms for quantum computing. These qubits leverage the unique properties of superconducting circuits to create controllable quantum systems to realize the quantum computing ideas we've explored in previous chapters.

## What are superconducting qubits?

Superconducting qubits are artificial quantum systems built from electrical circuits that include Josephson junctions - superconducting materials separated by a thin insulating barrier. When cooled to extremely low temperatures (typically below 100 mK), these circuits exhibit quantum behavior, allowing them to serve as qubits.

Unlike natural quantum systems such as atoms or ions, superconducting qubits are macroscopic objects - their physical dimensions can be on the order of hundreds of micrometers, making them visible to the naked eye. This macroscopic nature offers both advantages and challenges: they can be fabricated using modified integrated circuit technology, but are also more susceptible to environmental noise and decoherence.

### Types of superconducting qubits

There are several varieties of superconducting qubits, each with distinct characteristics and enabled by the amount of control these circuits have:

- **Transmon qubits**: A modified charge qubit designed to reduce sensitivity to charge noise, currently the most widely used superconducting qubit design.
- **Flux qubits**: Encode information in the direction of current flow, offering high anharmonicity.

Other designs include fluxonium and 0-$\pi$ qubits.

In this chapter, we'll explore how these qubits work, how they're controlled and measured, and how they implement the abstract quantum operations we've studied in previous chapters. We'll particularly focus on the transmon qubit, which has become the workhorse of many superconducting quantum processors due to its improved coherence properties.

## From electric circuits to a quantum harmonic oscillator

One of the key insights to develop our superconducting qubit is to make a connection with LC circuits and the harmonic oscillator. This allows us to develop out the quantum version of these circuits which we can explore in detail.

Consider a simple LC circuit composed of an inductor $L$ and a capacitor $C$. Suppose we start by giving the capacitor some initial charge $Q_0$. This initial charge causes a voltage across the capacitor plates, given approximately by $V_C = \tfrac{Q}{C}$. With time, this charge flows through the inductor; as current builds, it creates a magnetic field in the inductor, thereby storing energy in that field. Eventually, the capacitor’s voltage nears zero (the capacitor becomes discharged), but the current through the inductor continues due to its stored magnetic energy. This current then recharges the capacitor in the opposite polarity, and the energy flows between the capacitor’s electric field and the inductor’s magnetic field.

This back-and-forth exchange of energy repeats, creating an oscillation—just like a mass on a spring. In an LC circuit, the voltage drop across the inductor (given by $L dI/dt$) must match the voltage on the capacitor ($Q/C$). By summing these drops to zero around the loop, we arrive at the differential equation 
$$
L \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{Q}{C} = 0,
$$
where $I = \tfrac{dQ}{dt}$. Switching from the capacitor’s charge to an analogous “position” variable (the charge $Q$) and identifying the current with its time derivative, we recover the classic second-order differential equation and see the parallel between an LC circuit and the mass-spring system.
$$
\frac{d^2 Q}{dt^2} = -\frac1{LC} Q,
$$
where now $\omega^2 = \frac1{LC}$, and if we
solve this differential equation, we can use the standard approach for second-order linear differential equations with constant coefficients. The general solution has the form:

$$
Q(t) = A \cos(\omega t) + B \sin(\omega t),
$$

where $A$ and $B$ are constants determined by the initial conditions. If we assume that at $t=0$, the charge is $Q(0) = Q_0$ and the current is $I(0) = 0$ (meaning the capacitor is initially charged but no current is flowing), then:

$$
Q(0) = A = Q_0
$$

And since $I(t) = \frac{dQ}{dt}$:

$$
I(0) = \omega B = 0 \implies B = 0
$$

Therefore, the solution becomes:

$$
Q(t) = Q_0 \cos(\omega t)
$$

This represents a simple harmonic oscillation of the charge with angular frequency $\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$. The current can be found by taking the time derivative:

$$
I(t) = \frac{dQ}{dt} = -Q_0 \omega \sin(\omega t) = -\frac{Q_0}{\sqrt{LC}} \sin(\omega t)
$$

These equations show that the charge and current oscillate sinusoidally, with the current lagging the charge by a phase of $\pi/2$, exactly as we would expect in a classical harmonic oscillator.

## Historical Note: Circuit Analogies in Physics

The analogy between LC circuits and mechanical oscillators has a rich history dating back to the late 19th century. James Clerk Maxwell and Oliver Heaviside were among the first to formalize these connections. In the 1940s and 1950s, analog computers built from electrical circuits were used to simulate complex mechanical and fluid systems, solving differential equations that were otherwise intractable. These "electronic differential analyzers" could model everything from vibrating structures to nuclear reactions. The RLC circuit (adding resistance) became particularly important as it could simulate damped oscillators with friction. This tradition of using circuits as analog models continues today in the field of neuromorphic computing, where circuits mimic neural dynamics, and of course, in quantum computing with superconducting circuits.

### Quantum Mechanical Analogy

To make the connection to quantum mechanics more explicit, we can identify the analogous variables between the LC circuit and the quantum harmonic oscillator:

- The charge $Q$ on the capacitor corresponds to the position $x$ of the quantum oscillator
- The magnetic flux $\Phi = LI$ through the inductor corresponds to the momentum $p$ of the oscillator

This mapping becomes clear when we examine the energy stored in the circuit:

$$
E_{LC} = \frac{Q^2}{2C} + \frac{\Phi^2}{2L} = \frac{Q^2}{2C} + \frac{L I^2}{2}
$$

The first term represents the electrostatic energy stored in the capacitor, while the second term represents the magnetic energy stored in the inductor.

Compare this to the energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator:

$$
E_{oscillator} = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x^2 + \frac{p^2}{2m}
$$

The correspondence becomes:

$$
\frac{Q^2}{2C} \leftrightarrow \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x^2 \quad \text{(potential energy)}
$$

$$
\frac{L I^2}{2} \leftrightarrow \frac{p^2}{2m} \quad \text{(kinetic energy)}
$$

From these relations, we can identify:

- $Q \leftrightarrow x$
- $\Phi = LI \leftrightarrow p$
- $C \leftrightarrow \frac{1}{m\omega^2}$
- $L \leftrightarrow m$

This mapping allows us to translate the quantum harmonic oscillator formalism directly to the LC circuit, which becomes crucial when we quantize the circuit to create superconducting qubits. The commutation relation $[\hat{x},\hat{p}] = i\hbar$ in quantum mechanics translates to $[\hat{Q},\hat{\Phi}] = i\hbar$ for the LC circuit variables.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Understanding the Quantum Commutator

The commutation relation $[\hat{Q},\hat{\Phi}] = i\hbar$ is fundamental to the quantum behavior of the LC circuit. Let's explore what this means:

1. **Definition**: The commutator $[\hat{Q},\hat{\Phi}] = \hat{Q}\hat{\Phi} - \hat{\Phi}\hat{Q}$ measures the failure of these operators to commute.

2. **Physical meaning**: In classical physics, variables like position and momentum can be measured simultaneously with arbitrary precision. In quantum mechanics, the non-zero commutator implies that $\hat{Q}$ and $\hat{\Phi}$ cannot be precisely known simultaneously - this is a manifestation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

3. **Operator perspective**: When $Q$ and $\Phi$ become quantum operators, they act on the circuit's wavefunction. The charge operator $\hat{Q}$ can be expressed as $\hat{Q} = i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}\left(\frac{C}{L}\right)^{1/4}(\hat{a}^\dagger - \hat{a})$, while the flux operator $\hat{\Phi}$ becomes $\hat{\Phi} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{1/4}(\hat{a}^\dagger + \hat{a})$, where $\hat{a}$ and $\hat{a}^\dagger$ are the lowering and raising operators.

4. **Uncertainty relation**: This commutation relation directly leads to the uncertainty principle: $\Delta Q \cdot \Delta \Phi \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$, meaning that the more precisely we know the charge, the less precisely we can know the flux, and vice versa.

This quantum behavior is what allows us to create superposition states in superconducting circuits, forming the basis for superconducting qubits.

## Notation: Quantum Operators and the "Hat" Symbol

Throughout our discussion of quantum circuits, we use the "hat" notation (e.g., $\hat{Q}$, $\hat{\Phi}$) to distinguish quantum operators from classical variables. This distinction is important:

- A variable without a hat (e.g., $Q$, $\Phi$) represents a classical quantity with a definite value
- A variable with a hat (e.g., $\hat{Q}$, $\hat{\Phi}$) represents a quantum operator that acts on wavefunctions

Quantum operators correspond to observable quantities but, unlike classical variables, generally don't have definite values until measured. Instead, they represent the mathematical operations we perform on quantum states to calculate measurement probabilities and expectation values.
:::

Now that we've established the quantum operators for our circuit, we can write down the quantum Hamiltonian:

$$
\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{Q}^2}{2C} + \frac{\hat{\Phi}^2}{2L}
$$

This Hamiltonian is analogous to the quantum harmonic oscillator. We can rewrite it in terms of the raising and lowering operators $\hat{a}^\dagger$ and $\hat{a}$. Recall that:
$$
\hat{Q} = i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}\left(\frac{C}{L}\right)^{1/4}(\hat{a}^\dagger - \hat{a})
$$

$$
\hat{\Phi} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{1/4}(\hat{a}^\dagger + \hat{a})
$$

Substituting these expressions into our Hamiltonian:

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{H} &= \frac{1}{2C}\left(i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}\left(\frac{C}{L}\right)^{1/4}(\hat{a}^\dagger - \hat{a})\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2L}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{1/4}(\hat{a}^\dagger + \hat{a})\right)^2 \\
&= -\frac{\hbar}{4C}\left(\frac{C}{L}\right)^{1/2}(\hat{a}^\dagger - \hat{a})^2 + \frac{\hbar}{4L}\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{1/2}(\hat{a}^\dagger + \hat{a})^2 \\
\end{align}
$$

After algebraic manipulation and using the commutation relation $[\hat{a},\hat{a}^\dagger] = 1$, we arrive at:

$$
\hat{H} = \hbar\omega\left(\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a} + \frac{1}{2}\right)
$$

where $\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$ is the resonant frequency of the circuit.

::: {.callout-note}
## Commutation Relation for Raising and Lowering Operators

The commutation relation for the raising and lowering operators $\hat{a}^\dagger$ and $\hat{a}$ can be derived from the commutation relation between $\hat{Q}$ and $\hat{\Phi}$:

$$
[\hat{a}, \hat{a}^\dagger] = ?
$$

Starting with the expressions for $\hat{Q}$ and $\hat{\Phi}$ in terms of $\hat{a}$ and $\hat{a}^\dagger$:

$$
\hat{Q} = i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}\left(\frac{C}{L}\right)^{1/4}(\hat{a}^\dagger - \hat{a})
$$

$$
\hat{\Phi} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{1/4}(\hat{a}^\dagger + \hat{a})
$$

We can solve for $\hat{a}$ and $\hat{a}^\dagger$:

$$
\hat{a} = \frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{1/4}\frac{\hat{\Phi}}{\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}} - i\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{-1/4}\frac{\hat{Q}}{i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}}\right]
$$

$$
\hat{a}^\dagger = \frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{1/4}\frac{\hat{\Phi}}{\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}} + i\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{-1/4}\frac{\hat{Q}}{i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}}\right]
$$

Now we compute the commutator:
$$
\begin{aligned}
[\hat{a}, \hat{a}^\dagger] &= \hat{a}\hat{a}^\dagger - \hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a} \\
&= \frac{1}{4}\left[\left(\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{1/4}\frac{\hat{\Phi}}{\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}} - i\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{-1/4}\frac{\hat{Q}}{i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}}\right)\left(\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{1/4}\frac{\hat{\Phi}}{\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}} + i\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{-1/4}\frac{\hat{Q}}{i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}}\right) \right. \\
&\quad \left. - \left(\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{1/4}\frac{\hat{\Phi}}{\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}} + i\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{-1/4}\frac{\hat{Q}}{i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}}\right)\left(\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{1/4}\frac{\hat{\Phi}}{\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}} - i\left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{-1/4}\frac{\hat{Q}}{i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}}\right)\right] \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Let's define simpler variables to make this calculation more manageable:
$$
\begin{aligned}
A &= \left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{1/4}\frac{\hat{\Phi}}{\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}} \\
B &= \left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{-1/4}\frac{\hat{Q}}{i\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Then our commutator becomes:
$$
\begin{aligned}
[\hat{a}, \hat{a}^\dagger] &= \frac{1}{4}[(A - iB)(A + iB) - (A + iB)(A - iB)] \\
&= \frac{1}{4}[A^2 + iAB - iBA + B^2 - A^2 - iAB + iBA - B^2] \\
&= \frac{1}{4}[2i(BA - AB)] \\
&= \frac{i}{2}[\hat{B}, \hat{A}] \\
&= \frac{i}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{-1/4} \cdot \left(\frac{L}{C}\right)^{1/4} \cdot \frac{1}{\frac{\hbar}{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{i} \cdot [\hat{Q}, \hat{\Phi}] \\
&= \frac{i}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{\hbar} \cdot \frac{1}{i} \cdot (i\hbar) \\
&= \frac{i}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{\hbar} \cdot \hbar \\
&= 1
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, $[\hat{a}, \hat{a}^\dagger] = 1$, which is the canonical commutation relation for raising and lowering operators.
:::


### Solving the Quantum LC Circuit
To solve this system, we use the energy eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator, denoted as $|n\rangle$, where $n = 0, 1, 2, ...$. These states have the following properties:

1. $\hat{a}^\dagger|n\rangle = \sqrt{n+1}|n+1\rangle$ (raising operator)
2. $\hat{a}|n\rangle = \sqrt{n}|n-1\rangle$ (lowering operator)
3. $\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}|n\rangle = n|n\rangle$ (number operator)

These properties can be derived using the commutation relation $[\hat{a}, \hat{a}^\dagger] = 1$.
The energy eigenvalues are:

$$
E_n = \hbar\omega\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)
$$

This means the energy levels of our quantum LC circuit are:

1. Ground state ($n=0$): $E_0 = \frac{\hbar\omega}{2}$ (zero-point energy)
2. First excited state ($n=1$): $E_1 = \frac{3\hbar\omega}{2}$
3. Second excited state ($n=2$): $E_2 = \frac{5\hbar\omega}{2}$
4. ...

And so on, with each subsequent energy level following the pattern $E_n = \hbar\omega(n + \frac{1}{2})$.

And so on, with equal spacing of $\hbar\omega$ between adjacent levels.

The wavefunctions in the charge basis can be expressed as:

$$
\psi_n(Q) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n n!}}\left(\frac{C\omega}{\pi\hbar}\right)^{1/4} e^{-\frac{CQ^2}{2\hbar}} H_n\left(Q\sqrt{\frac{C\omega}{\hbar}}\right)
$$

where $H_n$ are the Hermite polynomials.

To make the connection to superconducting qubits clearer, we can rewrite our quantum LC oscillator Hamiltonian in terms of more physically relevant quantities: the charging energy and the reduced flux.

### Charging Energy and Reduced Flux

The Hamiltonian of our quantum LC circuit is:

$$
\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{Q}^2}{2C} + \frac{\hat{\Phi}^2}{2L}
$$

Let's introduce the following quantities:

1. **Charging Energy**: $E_C = \frac{e^2}{2C}$, where $e$ is the elementary charge. This represents the energy needed to add a single electron to the capacitor.
2. **Flux Quantum**: $\Phi_0 = \frac{h}{2e}$, the superconducting flux quantum.
3. **Reduced Flux**: $\hat{\varphi} = \frac{2\pi\hat{\Phi}}{\Phi_0}$, a dimensionless quantity.
4. **Number Operator**: $\hat{n} = \frac{\hat{Q}}{2e}$, which counts the number of Cooper pairs.

With these definitions, we can rewrite our operators:

$$
\hat{Q} = 2e\hat{n}
$$

$$
\hat{\Phi} = \frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi}\hat{\varphi}
$$

Substituting these into our Hamiltonian:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{H} &= \frac{(2e\hat{n})^2}{2C} + \frac{\left(\frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi}\hat{\varphi}\right)^2}{2L} \\
&= \frac{4e^2\hat{n}^2}{2C} + \frac{\Phi_0^2\hat{\varphi}^2}{8\pi^2L} \\
&= 4E_C\hat{n}^2 + \frac{\Phi_0^2}{8\pi^2L}\hat{\varphi}^2
\end{aligned}
$$

We can further define the inductive energy $E_L = \frac{\Phi_0^2}{4\pi^2L}$, which gives us:

$$
\hat{H} = 4E_C\hat{n}^2 + \frac{E_L}{2}\hat{\varphi}^2
$$

This form of the Hamiltonian is particularly useful because:

1. It expresses the energy in terms of discrete Cooper pairs ($\hat{n}$)
2. It uses the reduced flux ($\hat{\varphi}$), which has a direct physical interpretation in superconducting circuits
3. The energy scales $E_C$ and $E_L$ can be engineered by circuit design

The commutation relation between these operators becomes:

$$
[\hat{\varphi}, \hat{n}] = i
$$

This formulation helps us understand the quantum LC circuit in terms of charge and flux quanta, which is essential for developing superconducting qubits. The harmonic oscillator energy levels in this notation are:

$$
E_n = \hbar\omega\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) = \sqrt{8E_CE_L}\left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)
$$

where $\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} = \sqrt{\frac{8E_CE_L}{\hbar^2}}$.

### The Need for Anharmonicity

This infinite ladder of equally spaced energy levels is characteristic of harmonic oscillators. While this system is quantum mechanical, it's unsuitable for quantum computing because we cannot selectively address just two energy levels. If we tried to use the lowest two levels ($\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$) as our qubit states, any operation that excites $\ket{0}$ to $\ket{1}$ would also excite $\ket{1}$ to $\ket{2}$, $\ket{2}$ to $\ket{3}$, and so on, making it impossible to maintain a two-level system.

What we need is anharmonicity - unequal spacing between energy levels - so that the transition energy $E_{0\rightarrow 1}$ (from $\ket{0}$ to $\ket{1}$) differs from $E_{1\rightarrow 2}$ (from $\ket{1}$ to $\ket{2}$). This allows us to selectively address only the $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ states with appropriately tuned control pulses.

To achieve this anharmonicity, we must introduce a nonlinear element into our circuit - which is precisely what the Josephson junction provides, as we'll explore in the next section.

## The artificial atom

To create a qubit from our quantum circuit, we need to transform the harmonic oscillator into an artificial atom with discrete, _addressable_ energy levels. This requires introducing anharmonicity - unequal spacing between energy levels - into our system. In the following sections, we'll explore how the Josephson junction provides the necessary nonlinearity to achieve this anharmonicity. By incorporating this element into our circuit, we can engineer an artificial atom with customizable properties, where the lowest two energy levels can be isolated and controlled as a qubit. This approach leverages the macroscopic quantum behavior of superconducting circuits to create a scalable platform for quantum information processing.

## The Dual Role of Superconductivity

Superconductivity plays two crucial roles in our quantum circuits:

1. **Zero Resistance**: Superconducting materials conduct electricity with absolutely no resistance, allowing quantum states to persist without energy dissipation. This property is essential for maintaining quantum coherence in our circuits.

2. **Josephson Effect**: Superconductivity enables the Josephson effect, which occurs when two superconductors are separated by a thin insulating barrier. Cooper pairs can tunnel through this barrier coherently, creating a nonlinear element that's essential for introducing anharmonicity into our quantum system.

Without superconductivity, we would neither have the low-loss environment needed for quantum operations nor the nonlinear element (Josephson junction) required to create addressable energy levels for our qubit.
:::



### The Josephson Junction

To create our artificial atom, we need to introduce nonlinearity into our quantum circuit. This is achieved through the Josephson junction - a superconducting device consisting of two superconductors separated by a thin insulating barrier.

The Josephson junction is governed by two key relations:

1. The DC Josephson effect, relating the supercurrent through the junction to the phase difference:
   $$I = I_c \sin\varphi$$
   where $I_c$ is the critical current and $\varphi$ is the phase difference across the junction.

2. The AC Josephson effect, relating the voltage across the junction to the rate of change of the phase:
   $$V = \frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi}\frac{d\varphi}{dt}$$

The energy stored in a Josephson junction is given by:
$$E_J(\varphi) = -E_J\cos\varphi$$
where $E_J = \frac{\Phi_0 I_c}{2\pi}$ is the Josephson energy.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Deriving the Josephson Junction Energy

We can derive the energy stored in a Josephson junction by considering the work done when a current flows through it:

$$W = \int P dt = \int VI dt = \int V \frac{dQ}{dt} dt = \int V dQ$$

Using the AC Josephson relation, $V = \frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi}\frac{d\varphi}{dt}$, we can substitute:

$$W = \int \frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi}\frac{d\varphi}{dt} dQ$$

Since $I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$ and $I = I_c \sin\varphi$ from the DC Josephson relation:

$$W = \int \frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi}\frac{d\varphi}{dt} \cdot I_c \sin\varphi \cdot dt = \frac{\Phi_0 I_c}{2\pi} \int \sin\varphi \, d\varphi$$

Integrating, we get:

$$W = -\frac{\Phi_0 I_c}{2\pi} \cos\varphi + \text{constant}$$

The energy stored in the junction is therefore:

$$E_J(\varphi) = -E_J\cos\varphi$$

where $E_J = \frac{\Phi_0 I_c}{2\pi}$ is the Josephson energy. This nonlinear energy-phase relationship is what gives the Josephson junction its crucial anharmonic properties.
:::


### The Transmon Qubit

By replacing the inductor in our LC circuit with a Josephson junction, we create a nonlinear oscillator. The Hamiltonian becomes:

$$\hat{H} = 4E_C\hat{n}^2 - E_J\cos\hat{\varphi}$$

This is fundamentally different from the harmonic oscillator because the $\cos\hat{\varphi}$ term introduces anharmonicity. We can expand this cosine term:

$$\cos\hat{\varphi} \approx 1 - \frac{\hat{\varphi}^2}{2} + \frac{\hat{\varphi}^4}{24} - ...$$

Substituting this into our Hamiltonian:

$$\hat{H} \approx 4E_C\hat{n}^2 - E_J\left(1 - \frac{\hat{\varphi}^2}{2} + \frac{\hat{\varphi}^4}{24} - ...\right)$$

Rearranging:

$$\hat{H} \approx -E_J + 4E_C\hat{n}^2 + \frac{E_J}{2}\hat{\varphi}^2 - \frac{E_J}{24}\hat{\varphi}^4 + ...$$

The first term is just a constant energy offset. The second and third terms resemble our harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. The fourth term introduces anharmonicity - it makes the energy levels unequally spaced.

In practice, the ratio between the Josephson energy $E_J$ and the charging energy $E_C$ plays a crucial role in determining the properties of superconducting qubits. The superconducting qubit community has converged toward circuit designs with $E_J \gg E_C$ for several important reasons.

#### The $E_J/E_C$ Ratio and Charge Sensitivity

When $E_J \leq E_C$, as in the earlier Cooper-pair box charge qubit designs, the qubit becomes highly sensitive to charge noise. This sensitivity leads to shorter coherence times and less reliable qubit operation. In contrast, operating in the $E_J \gg E_C$ regime significantly reduces this charge sensitivity.

#### Charge Dispersion and Energy Levels

To understand why the $E_J \gg E_C$ regime is advantageous, we need to examine how the energy levels depend on the offset charge $n_g$. The offset charge represents the effect of the electrostatic environment on the qubit, including stray charges that can fluctuate over time.

The Hamiltonian with an offset charge $n_g$ is:

$$\hat{H} = 4E_C(\hat{n} - n_g)^2 - E_J\cos\hat{\varphi}$$

In the charge basis, we can compute the energy eigenvalues by diagonalizing this Hamiltonian. The resulting energy bands $E_m(n_g)$ depend on both the quantum number $m$ and the offset charge $n_g$.

For a Cooper-pair box (where $E_J \lesssim E_C$), the energy levels as a function of $n_g$ look like:

- When $E_J \ll E_C$: The energy bands are approximately parabolas centered at integer values of $n_g$, with small anticrossings at half-integer values.
- When $E_J \approx E_C$: The bands flatten somewhat, but still show significant dependence on $n_g$.

In both cases, the energy difference between the ground and first excited states varies significantly with $n_g$, making the qubit frequency highly sensitive to charge fluctuations.

As we increase the ratio $E_J/E_C$, the dependence of energy levels on $n_g$ becomes exponentially suppressed. The energy bands flatten out, and the variation in energy with $n_g$ (called charge dispersion) decreases exponentially:

$$\epsilon_m \approx (\text{some factors}) \times e^{-\sqrt{8E_J/E_C}}$$

This equation shows that the charge sensitivity decreases exponentially as the ratio $E_J/E_C$ increases. The important takeaway is that making $E_J$ much larger than $E_C$ dramatically reduces the qubit's sensitivity to charge noise.

This exponential suppression of charge sensitivity comes with a trade-off, however. As we increase the $E_J/E_C$ ratio by reducing $E_C$ (typically by adding a larger shunt capacitor), the anharmonicity 

$$\alpha \approx -E_C + (\text{constant}) \frac{E_C^2}{E_J} + \cdots $$

also decreases in magnitude. This creates a fundamental design tension:

- Higher $E_J/E_C$ → Better charge noise immunity → Lower anharmonicity
- Lower $E_J/E_C$ → Worse charge noise immunity 

Since the anharmonicity determines how well we can selectively address the $|0\rangle$ to $|1\rangle$ transition without exciting higher energy levels, it cannot be too small without risking leakage out of the computational subspace during control operations. In practice, transmon designs typically aim for an anharmonicity of around 200-300 MHz, which is sufficient for selective control while maintaining good charge noise immunity with $E_J/E_C$ ratios of 50-100.

This exponential suppression of charge sensitivity is the key advantage of the transmon regime. By operating with $E_J/E_C \approx 50-100$, we can reduce charge noise sensitivity by several orders of magnitude compared to the Cooper-pair box, while still maintaining sufficient anharmonicity for qubit operations.


#### Definition of the Transmon Qubit

The transmon (transmission-line shunted plasma oscillation qubit) is a type of superconducting qubit that consists of a Josephson junction shunted by a large capacitor. This design specifically operates in the regime where $E_J \gg E_C$, typically with ratios between 50 and 100. The large shunting capacitor $C_s \gg C_J$ reduces the charging energy $E_C$, making the qubit exponentially less sensitive to charge noise while maintaining sufficient anharmonicity to operate as a qubit.

To access the $E_J \gg E_C$ regime, the preferred approach is to make the charging energy $E_C$ small by shunting the Josephson junction with a large capacitor, $C_s \gg C_J$. This design is the foundation of the transmon qubit. In this limit, the superconducting phase $\varphi$ becomes approximately a good quantum number, meaning the quantum fluctuations of $\varphi$ represented by the wavefunction are small.

## Energy Level Discreteness and the $E_J/E_C$ Balance

While operating in the $E_J \gg E_C$ regime reduces charge sensitivity, it's important to note that the energy level spacing still depends on $E_C$. As $E_J/E_C$ increases, the phase $\varphi$ becomes a better quantum number, but the energy levels also become more closely spaced (since $\alpha \approx -E_C$).

This creates a careful balancing act in transmon design: we want $E_J/E_C$ large enough to suppress charge noise, but not so large that the energy levels become too closely spaced to distinguish and address individually. If the anharmonicity becomes too small, it becomes difficult to selectively drive transitions between only two levels without exciting higher states, compromising our ability to treat the system as a qubit.

Typical transmon designs strike this balance with $E_J/E_C$ ratios between 50 and 100, providing sufficient charge noise insensitivity while maintaining adequate level separation for reliable qubit operations.
:::


#### Anharmonicity in the Transmon

The negative coefficient of the quartic term in our expanded Hamiltonian indicates that the anharmonicity $\alpha = E_{12} - E_{01}$ (the difference between consecutive energy level spacings) is negative. This means that the energy required to excite from the first excited state to the second excited state is less than that required to excite from the ground state to the first excited state.

In practical transmon designs, the anharmonicity $\alpha \approx -E_C$ is usually engineered to be around 100-300 MHz. The qubit frequency $\omega_q = \sqrt{8E_J E_C}/h - E_C/h$ typically falls in the range of 3-6 GHz. To effectively suppress charge sensitivity, the energy ratio is made sufficiently large, with $E_J/E_C \geq 50$ being common.

#### The Transmon as a Weakly Anharmonic Oscillator

Due to this design, the transmon qubit is fundamentally a weakly anharmonic oscillator (AHO). While we often treat it as a quantum two-level system for simplicity, it's important to remember that higher energy levels physically exist and can be accessed. In fact, these higher levels have proven useful in implementing more efficient gate operations in some quantum computing protocols.
### The Duffing Oscillator Representation

The transmon Hamiltonian can be rewritten in a form that makes its nature as a weakly anharmonic oscillator more explicit. Using the creation and annihilation operators from the harmonic oscillator formalism, we can express the transmon Hamiltonian as a Duffing oscillator:

$$\hat{H} = \hbar\omega_q \hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a} + \frac{\alpha}{2}\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}^\dagger\hat{a}\hat{a}$$

Here, $\omega_q$ is the qubit frequency (approximately $\sqrt{8E_J E_C}/\hbar - E_C/\hbar$), and $\alpha$ is the anharmonicity (approximately $-E_C/\hbar$). The first term represents the harmonic part of the oscillator, while the second term introduces the anharmonicity that makes the energy levels unequally spaced.

This representation clearly shows that the transmon is essentially a harmonic oscillator with a perturbation that shifts the energy levels. The negative anharmonicity means that as we climb the energy ladder, each successive transition requires slightly less energy than the previous one.

### Effective Two-Level System Hamiltonian

Although the transmon is a multi-level system, when we restrict our focus to the lowest two energy levels (ground state $|0\rangle$ and first excited state $|1\rangle$), we can represent it as an effective two-level system or qubit. In this subspace, the Hamiltonian takes the form:

$$\hat{H}_\text{qubit} = -\frac{\hbar\omega_q}{2}Z$$

where $\hat{\sigma}_z$ is the Pauli-Z operator. This is the standard form for a qubit Hamiltonian in the energy eigenbasis, with the energy difference between the $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ states being $\hbar\omega_q$.

It's important to note that this two-level approximation is valid only when:

1. The control pulses used to manipulate the qubit are sufficiently selective in frequency to avoid exciting higher energy levels
2. The pulse shapes are designed to minimize leakage to higher states
3. The system temperature is low enough that thermal excitation to higher states is negligible

The presence of higher energy levels in the transmon, while often ignored in the two-level approximation, can lead to effects like leakage errors during gate operations. Advanced control techniques must account for these higher levels to achieve high-fidelity quantum operations.

### Tunable qubits

One of the most powerful features we can add to a transmon qubit is the ability to tune its frequency. This tunability gives us precise control over how qubits interact with each other, which is crucial for quantum computing.

::: {.callout-note}
## What Does "In Resonance" Mean?

In quantum mechanics, two systems are "in resonance" when they have the same energy difference between their states. Think of two musical tuning forks - when they have the same frequency, striking one can cause the other to vibrate. Similarly, when two qubits are in resonance, they can exchange quantum information efficiently.

Being able to control when qubits are in resonance is crucial because:

1. We can bring qubits into resonance when we want them to work together
2. We can take them out of resonance when we want them to work independently
3. We can prevent unwanted interactions between multiple qubits by giving them different frequencies
:::

The most common way to make a tunable transmon is to replace its single Josephson junction with two junctions in parallel, forming a loop. This structure is called a DC SQUID (Superconducting QUantum Interference Device). By applying a magnetic field through this loop, we can control how the device behaves.

When we use two identical junctions, the phases across them ($\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$) are related to the magnetic flux $\Phi$ through the loop by:

$$\varphi_1 - \varphi_2 + 2\pi k = 2\pi\frac{\Phi}{\Phi_0},$$

for an integer $k$. Here, $\Phi_0 = h/2e$ is the magnetic flux quantum - a fundamental constant in superconductivity that appears frequently in these systems.

This arrangement changes the effective Josephson energy of our circuit. Instead of being fixed, it now depends on the magnetic flux:

$$E_J(\Phi) = 2E_{J}\left|\cos\left(\pi\frac{\Phi}{\Phi_0}\right)\right|$$

where $E_{J}$ is the Josephson energy of each individual junction. This leads to a modified transmon Hamiltonian:

$$\hat{H} = 4E_C\hat{n}^2 - 2E_{J}\left|\cos\left(\pi\frac{\Phi}{\Phi_0}\right)\right|\cos\hat{\varphi}$$

As a result, we can tune the qubit's frequency by changing the magnetic flux:

$$\omega_q(\Phi) \approx \sqrt{\frac{8E_C}{\hbar^2}2E_{J}\left|\cos\left(\pi\frac{\Phi}{\Phi_0}\right)\right|} - \frac{E_C}{\hbar}$$

While this tunability is valuable, it comes with a drawback: sensitivity to fluctuations in the magnetic field, called flux noise. We can measure this sensitivity by looking at how much the frequency changes when we slightly change the flux:

$$\left|\frac{\partial\omega_q}{\partial\Phi}\right|$$

The qubit is most stable when the flux is a whole number multiple of $\Phi_0$, where small changes in flux have minimal effect on the frequency. However, we often need to operate at other flux values where the qubit becomes more sensitive to noise.

**A Better Design: The Asymmetric SQUID**: To address this problem, we can make one junction larger than the other in our SQUID. This asymmetric design changes the effective Josephson energy to:

$$E_J(\Phi) = E_{J\Sigma}\sqrt{d^2 + (1-d^2)\cos^2\left(\pi\frac{\Phi}{\Phi_0}\right)}$$

Here, $E_{J\Sigma} = E_{J1} + E_{J2}$ is the total Josephson energy of both junctions, and $d = (E_{J1} - E_{J2})/(E_{J1} + E_{J2})$ measures how different the junctions are. This design makes the qubit less sensitive to flux noise while still allowing us to tune its frequency.

When we have multiple qubits on the same chip, we need to carefully manage their frequencies to prevent unwanted interactions. This becomes especially important when performing two-qubit operations like the controlled-phase gate, where we deliberately bring two qubits into resonance. We'll explore these quantum operations and the precise timing and frequency control they require in later sections.

### The Flux Qubit and Fluxonium

While we've focused on using charge as our quantum variable in the transmon, we could alternatively use flux. Recall our quantum LC oscillator - the flux and charge variables were conjugate to each other, much like position and momentum. Just as we can encode quantum information in charge states, we can encode it in persistent currents flowing clockwise or counterclockwise in a superconducting loop.

This alternative approach becomes particularly interesting when we consider the limitations of the transmon. While the transmon's reduced charge sensitivity makes it robust against noise, its relatively small negative anharmonicity (typically around -200 MHz) can lead to unwanted excitations to higher energy states during operations.

::: {.callout-note}
## Anharmonicity and Control Speed

With limited anharmonicity, we face a fundamental trade-off in qubit control. Fast control pulses have broad frequency content that can inadvertently excite transitions to higher states ($|2\rangle$, $|3\rangle$, etc.). To avoid this, we must use longer, gentler pulses that are more frequency-selective. However, these slower pulses mean our quantum operations take more time. Even with careful pulse shaping, some small leakage to higher states may be unavoidable due to the uncertainty principle - very short pulses must have some frequency spread. This balance between operation speed and unwanted excitations is a key consideration in qubit design.
:::

The flux qubit offers a different approach. In its basic form, it consists of a superconducting loop interrupted by three Josephson junctions - one smaller junction with Josephson energy $E_J$ and two larger junctions, each with energy $\alpha E_J$ where $\alpha > 1$. The approximate Hamiltonian is:

$$
\hat{H} = 4E_C\hat{n}^2 - E_J(\cos(2\hat{\varphi}+2\pi f) + 2\alpha\cos(\hat{\varphi}))
$$

where $f = \Phi/\Phi_0$ is the reduced flux through the loop. To minimize flux noise sensitivity, we typically operate at $f = 1/2 + k$.

The potential energy landscape of this system can exhibit either single-well or double-well behavior, depending on the parameter $\alpha$:

1. Double-Well Regime ($\alpha > 2$): This creates the "persistent-current flux qubit". The two lowest energy states correspond to clockwise and counterclockwise persistent currents in the loop. These states have minimal overlap, leading to very large anharmonicity (often several GHz) and potentially longer relaxation times.

2. Single-Well Regime ($\alpha < 2$): Similar to the transmon but with positive anharmonicity, making it less susceptible to leakage to higher states during operations. This is often implemented as the "capacitively shunted flux qubit".

The fluxonium qubit takes this concept further by adding an array of many larger Josephson junctions (typically N ≈ 50-100 junctions) in series with the small junction. These larger junctions act together as a "superinductance" - effectively a very large inductor with low dissipation. When we add this array, we get an additional inductive energy term in our Hamiltonian:

$$
\hat{H} = 4E_C\hat{n}^2 + \frac{1}{2}E_L\hat{\varphi}^2 - E_J\cos(\hat{\varphi} + 2\pi f)
$$

Let's break down what each term means physically:

- The first term ($4E_C\hat{n}^2$) is our familiar charging energy from before
- The middle term ($\frac{1}{2}E_L\hat{\varphi}^2$) is the inductive energy from our junction array
- The last term ($-E_J\cos(\hat{\varphi} + 2\pi f)$) is the Josephson energy of the small junction

The inductive energy $E_L$ comes from the array of N junctions acting together. Each junction in the array has a Josephson energy $\alpha E_J$ (where $\alpha > 1$) larger than our small junction energy $E_J$. When we connect N of them in series, the effective inductive energy becomes $E_L = \frac{\alpha E_J}{N}$. This linear scaling with N allows us to create very large inductances by using many junctions in series, hence the term "superinductance".

::: {.callout-note}
## Plasmon vs Fluxon States

The fluxonium exhibits two types of excitations:

- Plasmon states: Small oscillations within a potential well, similar to LC oscillator states
- Fluxon states: Quantum tunneling between different wells, corresponding to different numbers of flux quanta threading the loop

The junction array provides a large kinetic inductance, which helps protect against charge noise while maintaining strong anharmonicity. This makes the fluxonium particularly promising for achieving long coherence times.
:::

The fluxonium combines advantages of both charge-based and flux-based qubits: it inherits protection against charge noise from its superinductance (the junction array) while maintaining the strong anharmonicity characteristic of flux qubits. This makes it an increasingly attractive option for quantum computing applications, though its more complex structure presents additional engineering challenges.

To better understand the fluxonium's behavior, let's expand the potential term in the Hamiltonian around $\varphi = 0$ (with $f=1/2$ for simplicity):

$$
-E_J\cos(\hat{\varphi} + \pi) = E_J\cos(\hat{\varphi}) = E_J\left(1 - \frac{\hat{\varphi}^2}{2} + \frac{\hat{\varphi}^4}{24} - ...\right)
$$

The total potential energy, including both the inductive and Josephson terms, becomes:

$$
V(\hat{\varphi}) = \frac{1}{2}E_L\hat{\varphi}^2 + E_J\left(1 - \frac{\hat{\varphi}^2}{2} + \frac{\hat{\varphi}^4}{24} - ...\right)
$$

Collecting terms up to fourth order:

$$
V(\hat{\varphi}) \approx E_J + \frac{1}{2}(E_L - E_J)\hat{\varphi}^2 + \frac{E_J}{24}\hat{\varphi}^4
$$

This fourth-order expansion reveals the competition between the quadratic term (which determines the well shape) and the quartic term (which introduces anharmonicity). The behavior depends on the relative magnitudes of $E_L$ and $E_J$:

1. When $E_L - E_J > 0$, the quadratic term is positive, resulting in a single-well potential
2. When $E_L - E_J < 0$, the quadratic term is negative while the quartic term remains positive, creating a double-well potential

The anharmonicity can be estimated by treating the quartic term as a perturbation. For the single-well case, the unperturbed states are harmonic oscillator states with frequency $\omega_0 = \sqrt{(E_L - E_J)/E_C}$. The first-order correction to the energy levels due to the quartic term gives an anharmonicity of approximately:

$$
\alpha = (E_{12} - E_{01}) \approx \frac{E_J}{24}\left(\frac{E_C}{E_L - E_J}\right)^{1/2}
$$

This shows that the fluxonium can achieve substantial anharmonicity (comparable to or exceeding that of the transmon) while maintaining protection against both charge and flux noise through appropriate choice of $E_L$, $E_J$, and $E_C$.


::: {.callout-tip}
## Similar Analysis for Flux Qubits

A similar potential analysis can be performed for the flux qubit, which has a Hamiltonian of the form:

$$
\hat{H} = 4E_C\hat{n}^2 - E_J\cos(2\hat{\varphi} + 2\pi f) - 2E_J\alpha\cos(\hat{\varphi})
$$

where $\alpha$ is the ratio of the Josephson energies of the two junctions. Expanding around $f=1/2$ and $\varphi=0$ yields:

$$
V(\hat{\varphi}) \approx \text{const} - E_J(2-\alpha)\hat{\varphi}^2 - \left( \frac{2}{3} - \frac{\alpha}{12}\right)\hat{\varphi}^4
$$

This reveals how the double-well potential emerges when $\alpha > 2$, with the barrier height controlled by $\alpha$. The key difference from the fluxonium is that the flux qubit lacks the inductive energy term, making it more susceptible to flux noise.
:::

## Coupling Qubits

To perform quantum computations, we need our qubits to interact with each other in controlled ways - this is how we create quantum gates. Let's explore the two main ways we can manipulate superconducting qubits.

### Direct Coupling Between Qubits

Just like classical circuits can be connected through components, superconducting qubits can be coupled through:

1. **Capacitive Coupling**: Connecting qubits through capacitors allows them to interact via electric fields
2. **Inductive Coupling**: Using inductors or shared magnetic flux lines creates magnetic coupling
3. **Direct Junction Coupling**: Sharing Josephson junctions between qubits

The interaction Hamiltonian typically takes the form:

$$
H_{\text{int}} = g(\hat{a}_1^\dagger\hat{a}_2 + \hat{a}_1\hat{a}_2^\dagger)
$$

where $g$ is the coupling strength and $\hat{a}_i$ are the qubit operators.

### Microwave Control: "Driving" the Qubits

We can also manipulate qubits using carefully designed microwave pulses. This is like playing a very precise musical instrument:

$$
H_{\text{drive}}(t) = \Omega(t)\cos(\omega t + \phi)(\hat{a} + \hat{a}^\dagger)
$$

where:

- $\Omega(t)$ is the pulse amplitude (how strong)
- $\omega$ is the frequency (what note)
- $\phi$ is the phase (timing)

::: {.callout-note}
## Common Pulse Sequences

1. **π-pulse**: Flips a qubit from |0⟩ to |1⟩ (or vice versa)
2. **π/2-pulse**: Creates superposition states
3. **DRAG pulses**: Specially shaped pulses that reduce leakage to unwanted states
:::

### Creating Gates Through Pulse Engineering

Modern quantum computers use both coupling and pulses to create gates:

1. **Single-Qubit Gates**: 
   - Implemented using microwave pulses
   - Example: X gate = single π-pulse
   - Example: H gate = π/2-pulse with specific phase

2. **Two-Qubit Gates**:
   - Use combination of coupling and pulses
   - Example: CNOT = coupling + specific pulse sequence
   - Example: iSWAP = natural evolution under coupling + control pulses

**The Art of Pulse Sequences**
Think of quantum gates like a choreographed dance:

1. Start with basic "moves" (primitive gates)
2. Combine them in specific sequences
3. Optimize timing and shapes
4. Account for real hardware constraints

::: {.callout-important}
## Key Considerations for Pulse Design

- **Bandwidth**: Pulses must fit within system limitations
- **Crosstalk**: Avoid affecting neighboring qubits
- **Decoherence**: Complete operations before quantum information is lost
- **Calibration**: Regular tuning of pulse parameters

### Capacitive Coupling Between Qubits

Another fundamental coupling mechanism between superconducting qubits is capacitive coupling, where the interaction arises from the voltage difference between the qubits. The interaction energy for two qubits coupled through a capacitance $C_g$ is:

$$
E_{\text{int}} = C_gV_1V_2
$$

Since the voltage operators are proportional to the charge operators ($\hat{V} = \frac{2e}{C}\hat{n}$), this leads to an interaction Hamiltonian of the form:

$$
H_{\text{int}} = \frac{4e^2C_g}{C_1C_2}\hat{n}_1\hat{n}_2
$$

The full Hamiltonian for two capacitively coupled qubits becomes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
H &= H_1 + H_2 + H_{\text{int}} \\
&= 4E_{C1}\hat{n}_1^2 + 4E_{C2}\hat{n}_2^2 + \frac{1}{2}E_{L1}\hat{\varphi}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}E_{L2}\hat{\varphi}_2^2 \\
&\quad - E_{J1}\cos(\hat{\varphi}_1) - E_{J2}\cos(\hat{\varphi}_2) + \frac{4e^2C_g}{C_1C_2}\hat{n}_1\hat{n}_2
\end{aligned}
$$

**Transformation to Creation/Annihilation Operators**
We can express the charge and phase operators in terms of creation and annihilation operators:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{n}_j &= in_{\text{zpf},j}(a_j^\dagger - a_j) \\
\hat{\varphi}_j &= \varphi_{\text{zpf},j}(a_j^\dagger + a_j)
\end{aligned}
$$

where $n_{\text{zpf},j}$ and $\varphi_{\text{zpf},j}$ are the zero-point fluctuations. Substituting these into the interaction term:

$$
H_{\text{int}} = \frac{4e^2C_g}{C_1C_2}n_{\text{zpf},1}n_{\text{zpf},2}(a_1^\dagger - a_1)(a_2^\dagger - a_2)
$$

#### Projection onto the Qubit Subspace
When we project the interaction Hamiltonian onto the computational basis states $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ of each qubit, we can express it in terms of Pauli operators. Let's work through this projection:

For a single qubit, the creation and annihilation operators have the following matrix elements in the {$|0\rangle$, $|1\rangle$} basis:

$$
a = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & 1 \\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
a^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 \\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Therefore, the combination $(a^\dagger - a)$ gives:

$$
(a^\dagger - a) = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -1 \\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix} = iY
$$

The interaction term $(a_1^\dagger - a_1)(a_2^\dagger - a_2)$ thus becomes:

$$
H_{\text{int}} = g(iY^{(1)})(iY^{(2)}) = -gY^{(1)}Y^{(2)}
$$

where $g = \frac{4e^2C_g}{C_1C_2}n_{\text{zpf},1}n_{\text{zpf},2}$ is the coupling strength.

Using the relation $Y = \frac{1}{i}(\sigma_+ - \sigma_-)$, we can rewrite this as:

$$
H_{\text{int}} = g(\sigma_1^+\sigma_2^- + \sigma_1^-\sigma_2^+)
$$

This is the familiar "flip-flop" interaction that conserves the total excitation number, allowing excitations to be exchanged between the qubits.

::: {.callout-note}
## Inductive Coupling and XX Interactions

While capacitive coupling gives rise to YY interactions between qubits, inductive coupling naturally produces XX interactions. This is because the current operator is proportional to X rather than Y. The interaction Hamiltonian takes the form:

$$
H_{\text{int}} = gX^{(1)}X^{(2)}
$$

where $g$ is proportional to the mutual inductance. Having access to both XX and YY interactions through different coupling mechanisms provides greater flexibility in quantum gate implementation and allows for the engineering of various types of qubit-qubit interactions.
:::




#### Coupling Through a Resonator

Rather than directly coupling qubits, we can engineer interactions by coupling qubits to a common resonator. The Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian for each qubit-resonator system is:

$$
H = \omega_r a^\dagger a + \frac{\omega_q}{2}\sigma^z + g(a^\dagger\sigma^- + a\sigma^+)
$$

In the dispersive limit where $|\Delta| = |\omega_q - \omega_r| \gg g$, we can eliminate the direct qubit-resonator coupling through a unitary transformation, yielding an effective qubit-qubit interaction:

$$
H_{\text{eff}} \approx \frac{g_1g_2}{\Delta}(\sigma_1^+\sigma_2^- + \sigma_1^-\sigma_2^+)
$$

This cavity-mediated coupling allows us to couple qubits separated by macroscopic distances (~1 cm) while maintaining strong interaction strengths, a significant advantage over direct coupling methods that require physical proximity (~1 mm).


### Inductive Coupling Between Qubits

The coupling between superconducting qubits can be achieved through various mechanisms, with inductive coupling being one of the most fundamental and versatile approaches. This coupling mechanism relies on the interaction between currents flowing through the qubits and their mutual inductance.

#### Mutual Inductance and Kinetic Inductance

When two circuits are placed in proximity, a current flowing in one circuit induces a magnetic flux in the other through mutual inductance $M$. The interaction energy is given by:

$$
E_{\text{int}} = MI_{\text{i}}I_{\text{ii}}
$$

In superconducting circuits, we benefit from an additional contribution to inductance known as kinetic inductance. Unlike geometric inductance, which arises from magnetic field energy storage, kinetic inductance stems from the kinetic energy of Cooper pairs. The total inductance is:

$$
L_{\text{total}} = L_{\text{geometric}} + L_{\text{kinetic}}
$$

This kinetic inductance can be significantly larger than geometric inductance in thin superconducting films, providing stronger coupling strengths than would be possible with purely electromagnetic interactions. The kinetic inductance contribution scales as:

$$
L_{\text{kinetic}} \propto \frac{m}{n_{\text{s}}e^2}
$$

where $n_s$ is the Cooper pair density.

#### Coupled Fluxonium Hamiltonian

For two inductively coupled fluxonium qubits, the interaction Hamiltonian arises from the mutual inductance between the currents:

$$
H_{int} = MI_1I_2 = M\left(\frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi}\right)^2\sin(\hat{\varphi}_1)\sin(\hat{\varphi}_2)
$$

The full Hamiltonian for the coupled system is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
H &= H_1 + H_2 + H_{int} \\
&= 4E_{C1}\hat{n}_1^2 + 4E_{C2}\hat{n}_2^2 + \frac{1}{2}E_{L1}\hat{\varphi}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}E_{L2}\hat{\varphi}_2^2 \\
&\quad - E_{J1}\cos(\hat{\varphi}_1) - E_{J2}\cos(\hat{\varphi}_2) + M\left(\frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi}\right)^2\sin(\hat{\varphi}_1)\sin(\hat{\varphi}_2)
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Energy Level Structure and Coupling

In the fluxonium regime where $E_L \ll E_J$, the potential forms a deep well around $\varphi = 0$. For small oscillations, we can expand the sine terms:

$$
\sin(\hat{\varphi}) \approx \hat{\varphi} - \frac{\hat{\varphi}^3}{6}
$$

The interaction term becomes:

$$
H_{int} \approx M\left(\frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi}\right)^2(\hat{\varphi}_1 - \frac{\hat{\varphi}_1^3}{6})(\hat{\varphi}_2 - \frac{\hat{\varphi}_2^3}{6})
$$

When projected onto the two lowest energy states of each fluxonium, the phase operator $\hat{\varphi}$ has diagonal matrix elements due to the asymmetry of the wavefunctions in the anharmonic potential:

$$
\langle g|\hat{\varphi}|g\rangle = -\langle e|\hat{\varphi}|e\rangle
$$

This leads naturally to the longitudinal coupling:

$$
H_{int} \approx \hbar g_{12}\sigma_z^{(1)}\sigma_z^{(2)}
$$

where $g_{12}$ is proportional to the mutual inductance $M$ and the matrix elements of $\hat{\varphi}$ in the qubit basis.

::: {.callout-important}
## Operating Point for Longitudinal Coupling

While the fluxonium operates in a regime with deep wells ($E_L \ll E_J$), it's crucial to note that pure longitudinal coupling requires a small but non-zero flux bias away from $\varphi = 0$. This is because:

1. At exactly $\varphi = 0$, the ground and excited states have symmetric wavefunctions, making $\langle g|\hat{\varphi}|g\rangle = \langle e|\hat{\varphi}|e\rangle = 0$
2. A small flux bias breaks this symmetry, creating distinct average flux states
3. Due to the deep well regime, even a small bias ($\varphi \sim 0.1$) is sufficient to achieve significant coupling
4. The states remain well-localized due to the large $E_J$, maintaining coherence

This subtle but essential tuning enables the desired $\sigma_z^{(1)}\sigma_z^{(2)}$ coupling while preserving the qubit's favorable noise properties.
:::


#### Advantages and Applications

This coupling mechanism offers several benefits:

1. **Pure Phase Coupling**: Enables entanglement without energy exchange
2. **Quantum Annealing**: Natural implementation of Ising-type interactions
   $$H_{Ising} = \sum_{i,j} J_{ij}\sigma_z^{(i)}\sigma_z^{(j)}$$
3. **Decoherence Resistance**: Less susceptible to charge noise
4. **Scalability**: Compatible with circuit QED architectures

#### Tunable Coupling via Mediator Qubit

The coupling strength can be made tunable by introducing an intermediate rf-SQUID between the qubits. The effective coupling becomes:

$$
g_{eff} = g_{12}(\Phi_x) = g_0\cos(\pi\Phi_x/\Phi_0)
$$

where $\Phi_x$ is the external flux through the mediator SQUID.

Trade-offs of this approach include:

- Enhanced coupling control
- Additional control line complexity
- Potential decoherence through the mediator
- Increased circuit footprint
